# UnknownCompany
This project is made to determine which files in the project contain the word TODO

As of right now, it needs to be placed in the directory in which it needs to be run.

Ideally, it would work by passing an argument in to iterate over all the sub-directories and files in args[1]

To run:
```
node findmyword.js
```
